# ATM-Project

Project Overview: 
By simulating an ATM system, customers can: 
1. Withdraw 
2. Deposit 
3. Pin Generation 
4. Check Balance 
5. Exit 

Description:
 In this project, I involved various operations in ATM like Withdrawal, Deposit, Pin Generation, Mini statements etc,..

Utilized Technologies: 
 1. Control Statements
 2. Conditional Statements
 3. Dictionary
 4. Variables
 5. Operations
 6. Lists

Functions: 
1. withdraw(): 
-------------- 
requests the PIN and account number. Verify that the account balance is adequate to cover the requested withdrawal amount if credentials are valid, and then updates it accordingly. 
2. deposit(): 
-------------- 
requests for the deposit amount, PIN, and account number. The deposit amount is added to the balance if the PIN is accurate. 
3. pin generation() 
---------------- 
permits creating a new 4-digit PIN for accounts without one with confirmation to guarantee accuracy. 
4. mini statement(): 
------------ 
displays the current balance after requesting the account number and PIN.

Tools:
 Google Colab

Project Outcome:
The project successfully simulates core banking operations, provided a hands-on experience in developing practical software solutions and showcased how small-scale simulations can mirror complex systems effectively. It was a great way to strengthen my skills in Python programming and problem-solving!
